## Sustainable Horse Care

Implementing sustainable horse care methods involves choosing products and practices that reduce environmental impact:

1. **Feed Choices**:

   - Opt for organic or locally-sourced hay and feed to minimize carbon footprint.
   - Explore hay alternatives like forage crops.

2. **Health Care Management**:

   - Use holistic approaches for health care, such as acupuncture and chiropractic care, which can reduce dependency on pharmaceuticals.
   - Consider herbal supplements and natural remedies when suitable.

3. **Horse Waste Management**:
   - Compost manure to create nutrient-rich fertilizer for gardens or fields, reducing waste and enhancing soil health.
   - Utilize a “paddock paradise” system to manage waste effectively by rotating grazing areas.
